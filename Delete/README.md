# Files to Delete

This directory contains legacy files that should be deleted after migration verification.

## Files moved here:
- Legacy Python files from root (now in servers/memory-palace/)
- Old bootstrap scripts (replaced by run.ps1)
- Old Dockerfile (now in servers/memory-palace/docker/)

## Action Required:
Once you've verified the migration is complete, delete this entire directory.
